React:


What are the key features of React?
Answer: Some key features of React include a virtual DOM for efficient updates, component-based architecture,
 declarative syntax, and the ability to use JSX to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.


What is the difference between props and state in React?
Answer: Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component, while state is used
 to manage data within a component.

What is the component lifecycle in React?
Answer: The component lifecycle in React refers to the series of phases that a component goes through
from initialization to destruction. The lifecycle methods include componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, 
componentWillUnmount, and others.




What is the purpose of the componentDidMount lifecycle method?
Answer: The componentDidMount method is called after a component is rendered for the first time. 
It is used to perform actions that require the component to be fully rendered, such as fetching data from
 an API or initializing third-party libraries.

ES6 Refresher:

Classes: Classes in JavaScript are a way to create reusable code that can be extended by other classes. You can use the class 
keyword to define a class and create instances of it using the new keyword.
Arrow Functions: Arrow functions are a shorthand way to write functions in JavaScript. They are more concise than
 traditional functions and don't create their own this value.
Variables (let, const, var): let and const are block-scoped variables that were introduced in ES6, while var is function-scoped.
 let allows you to declare variables that can be reassigned, while const is used for values that won't change. var is the
 old way of declaring variables in JavaScript and should be avoided in most cases.
Array Methods like .map(): The map() method creates a new array by applying a function to each element in the original array.
Destructuring: Destructuring is a way to extract values from objects and arrays and assign them to variables. It can be useful
for writing more concise code.
Spread Operator: The spread operator ... can be used to spread the elements of an array or object into a new array or object.
Modules: Modules are a way to organize and share code in JavaScript. You can use the import and export statements to import and export modules.
Introduction to SPA, MPA and React framework:

Best practices of front-end development: Best practices for front-end development include using semantic HTML, separating concerns with CSS and JavaScript, optimizing images and other assets, and testing your code.
Understanding Single Page Applications and Multi Page Applications: Single Page Applications (SPAs) are web applications that load all content dynamically, usually through AJAX requests. Multi Page Applications (MPAs) are traditional web applications that load new pages when links are clicked. React is typically used to build SPAs.
Introduction to React framework: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses a declarative syntax to describe how the UI should look and updates the UI automatically when data changes.
Features of React: React features include a virtual DOM for efficient updates, component-based architecture for reusable code, and a unidirectional data flow.
Advantages and Disadvantages of React: Advantages of React include its high performance, reusable components, and large community. Disadvantages include a steeper learning curve and the need for additional tooling.
Unit II ReactJS installation:

Installing React using Create React App: Create React App is a tool that sets up a new React project with a predefined folder structure and development server.
React Environment: React can be run in any modern web browser or server environment, but it's typically used with Node.js and NPM.
Folder Structure: Create React App sets up a folder structure with separate folders for public assets, source code, and configuration files.
JSX: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. It's used to define the structure of React components.
Understanding Component Basics: Components are the building blocks of React applications. They are reusable pieces of UI that can be composed together to create complex interfaces.
createElement() arguments: React.createElement() is a function that creates a new React element. It takes three arguments:
type: The type of element to create. This can be a string for HTML elements (e.g. 'div') or a React component.

props: An object of properties to assign to the element. These can include attributes like className and style, as well as custom props.

children: The content to render inside the element. This can be text, other React elements, or an array of these.

JSX vs React.createElement() method: JSX is a syntactic sugar that allows you to write React components using HTML-like syntax. It's transformed into React.createElement() calls by a build tool like Babel.

JSX expressions: JSX expressions can be used inside curly braces {} to include dynamic values in your JSX code.

Rendering Elements into DOM: React elements can be rendered into the DOM using the ReactDOM.render() method.

Components and styles in React: Components can have styles applied to them using inline styles, CSS stylesheets, or CSS modules. Inline styles are defined as a JavaScript object and passed to the style prop of a component. CSS stylesheets and modules are imported and applied to components using class names.

Unit III Understanding Hooks:

Hooks basics: Hooks are a way to add state and other features to function components in React. They were introduced in React 16.8.
Built-in hooks: React provides several built-in hooks, including useState for managing state, useEffect for side effects, useContext for accessing context, and others.
useState: useState is a hook that allows you to add state to a function component. It takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state.
useEffect: useEffect is a hook that allows you to perform side effects in a function component. It takes a callback function as an argument and runs it after every render.
useContext: useContext is a hook that allows you to access context in a function component. It takes a context object as an argument and returns the current context value.
useRef: useRef is a hook that allows you to create a mutable reference to a value in a function component. It's useful for accessing DOM elements or for persisting values between renders.
useReducer: useReducer is a hook that allows you to manage state using a reducer function. It's similar to Redux's useReducer hook.
useCallback: useCallback is a hook that memoizes a function and returns a memoized version of it. It's useful for preventing unnecessary re-renders of child components.
useMemo: useMemo is a hook that memoizes a value and returns a memoized version of it. It's useful for expensive computations that don't need to be re-run on every render.
custom hooks: Custom hooks are functions that use one or more built-in hooks to provide a specific behavior or feature to a function component.
Events, States and component lifecycle in React:

Event handling in React: Event handling in React is similar to handling events in HTML, but with some differences. You can use the onClick, onChange, and other event handler props to attach event listeners to elements.
Stateless and Stateful Components: Stateless components are components that don't have state and only render UI based on props. Stateful components have state and can update their UI based on changes to that state.
Creating State: State can be created using the useState hook or using a class component's state property.
Common pitfalls of state management: Some common pitfalls of state management in React include not understanding the lifecycle of a component, not updating the state correctly, and not properly managing asynchronous code.
Component Lifecycle: The component lifecycle in React refers to the different phases of a component's existence. It includes mounting, updating, and unmounting. During the mounting phase, the component is created and added to the DOM. During the updating phase, the component's state or props change, and the component re-renders. During the unmounting phase, the component is removed from the DOM.
Working with Forms:

Adding forms: You can add forms to a React application using the HTML 'form' element and adding form elements like 'input', 'select', and 'textarea'.
Handling forms: Form handling in React involves attaching event handlers to form elements and using the 'useState' hook to manage the form state.
Submitting forms: You can submit a form in React using the 'onSubmit' event handler and preventing the default behavior using the 'preventDefault' method.
Controlled and Uncontrolled Components: Controlled components are components that manage the form state using props and event handlers. Uncontrolled components, on the other hand, manage their own state using refs.
Forms validation - error checking and displaying errors: Form validation in React involves checking the form input values and displaying error messages if the input is invalid. You can use conditional rendering to display error messages.
HTTP Methods:

Fetch() and Axios: Fetch() and Axios are two popular libraries for making HTTP requests in JavaScript. Fetch() is a built-in method in JavaScript, while Axios is a third-party library.
GET Requests: GET requests are used to retrieve data from a server.
POST Requests: POST requests are used to send data to a server to create or update a resource.
PUT Requests: PUT requests are used to update an existing resource on the server.
DELETE Action: DELETE requests are used to delete a resource from the server.
Routing:

Setting up routing and routes: Routing in React involves defining routes and setting up a router to handle those routes. You can use the 'react-router-dom' library for routing in React.
Navigating to pages: You can navigate to different pages in a React application using the 'Link' component or the 'history' object.
Navigating back and next page: You can navigate back and forward in a React application using the browser's back and forward buttons or using the 'history' object.
Passing data via Query Params: You can pass data between pages in a React application using query parameters.
Passing data between pages: You can pass data between pages in a React application using props or by storing the data in a state management library like Redux.
Fetching data: You can fetch data from a server in a React application using HTTP methods and display that data on the UI.
